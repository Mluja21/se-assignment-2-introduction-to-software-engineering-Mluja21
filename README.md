Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
Software engineering is the design, development, testing and maintenance of software applicatons.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software engineering is a branch of knowledge focused on creating and implementing and mainting high-quality software solutions. It is different form traditional programming because traditional programming is solely focused on the coding of the programs and the maintenance of those programs with the use of available tools and methods, while software engineering takes it a step further and builds the structure and tools that the programmers will be using to code. An example at a company  a software engineer will be consulted on what laptops to buy, what type of servers,storage systems and developtment tools the company ought to buy along with managing the progress of the software, while programmers will just use machines and software available to code the programs solely.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
 Planning and analysis: The process of gathering information from the client on what is the issue and what is their desired end goal from the software to be created. HOw much it could potentially cost.
 Requirements: This is the phase where all the information gathered becomes a document outlining the exact system and user requirements the team will have to fulfill in order to successfully address the issue.
  Design: This is the phase where the development team details the programming language to be used, the software architecture concerning security measures to be used and designs a "rough draft' of the user interface wihtout actually coding much.
  Development: This is the proccess where the development team starts to code the project and it comes to life. if the project is huge, it can be broken amongst the team using, Scrum/Agile or waterfall.
  Testing: This is the phase where the team tests and debugs, bugs within the system.They test if the system does meet the requirements of the client satisfactorily . Usually testing and development happen simultaneously, so as to save time and avoid fixing a lot bugs at the end which might create new bugs. 
  Deployment: This is the release of the software to the end users and user feedback is analysed.
  Maintenance: This is the phase where they take user feedback and use it to enhance the software and the user experience. To provide ongoing support to the users. ([text](https://distantjob.com/blog/software-development-life-cycle-stages-and-models/))

Agiles. Waterfall Models:
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred_
The Agile model allows flexibility for change at any point in time during the proccess this allows the project to change according to the clients needs as they change due to market changes, theres constant communication between the members of the team and the roles are fluid. Compared to the waterfall model which is more rigid, as each person's role is cemented for the entire project, and the requirements can not be changed once the development proccess starts. Agile might be better development proccess for smaller firms, which are on a tight budget and can't afford getting software designed a 6 months ago and yet the market changes every 3 months, so with the agile they'll be able to ensure that the software meets current needs. While for waterfall model might be preferred by big business like banks, whose needs may likely be the same for a long period of time, so having a definitive pricing of a prject is good for them because their able to allocate the money easily unlike when the pricing keeps changing because requirements keep changing.

Requirements Engineering:
What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Requirements engineering is the documenting and verifying all the requirements that will be needed in terms of hardware needed to design and run the software, the technical skills needed for the project and the requirements needed to be met for the users. It is extremely important in the process. For an example a company wants to have a new system for communication amongst the workers on the construction sites and the project mangers not on site. If they don't get a professional to assess all needs and the most economical way to achieve them,they could buy expensive laptops and server racks for no reason. As they could've done with a simple setup off cloud-based services and software and save money on buying servers. 

Software Design Principles:
Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity is the concept of breaking up a very large system into individual parts that run independently and doesn't require the entire system to operate. This makes maintenance much easier as it allows for that individual part to be taken offline to be repaired and the system continues working just fine. This is makes it very easy to scale,as no matter ther size the principle will be the same. If the bank's website and cloud systems go down, you can still withdraw money from the atm's as those systems are seperate and may not neccesarily affect each other.

Testing in Software Engineering:
Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Unit testing by definition is testing of the smallest functional code to ensure it behaves as expected.(Such as testing a mathematical equation. ) 
While Intergration testing is testing how well will different modules coded by different programmers merge and work together as a combined unit. 
System testing- is the testing of the entire system's functionality and how well it can perform under pressure.For example testing, if there are thousands trying to login at the sametime, will the system freeze or crash, or will it hold up.
Acceptance testing- is the testing by the client and the end-users of the system. To see, if the system is satisfactory to their needs and the client chooses to accept the system not. 
Testing is very crucial in development simply because it ensures that everything is right and performs the way its supposed to and fulfills it's purpose. Without testing the client could recieve a bug filled system with other issues and they could choose not to pay.

Version Control Systems:
What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Version control systems are systems that were designed for Developers to allow them to track all changes made to any software code. If there is an error, it allows them to view the previous code before this incorrect code that doesn't work. (It's blockchain,but for developers,where instead of every transaction being tracked and stored forever. It's code changes that are tracked.) Git is a popular version control system as it is a distributed version control system, meaning the history of all changes are not on just one document rather every developer who has a copy of the code will each have full history and the changes made.

Software Project Management:
Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
A project manager, helps to design and ensure the execution of the software development. They asign different tasks to different members of the team and then monitor all member's of the teams progress. They also handle communication with the client and the seniors of the company. They help to simplify and give a status report on the progress made to clients and senior management who may not have technical know how to understand where the project is on their own. Their faced with challenges that everything is done time and they have to be the ones motivating the team and ensuring everyone is doing their piece,all while trying to keep the client happy.

Software Maintenance:
Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Software maintenance is the process of updating and modifying software to satisfy ever changing customer needs.There is preventive maintenance, which pertains to actively improving the security measures of the system,even when there hasn't been a security breach. Another important maintenance activity is corrective software maintenance that is when the developers analyse and seek to solve a error or bug that was reported by the end users. It is extremely important to the software lifecycle as it prolongs the usability of the software without maintenance and updates within a year the system would be almost worthless for some industries. Yet, if you want to ensure that the client gets value for their money, then they need support.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
The privacy of their users data, where is the line drawn, between needing data for algorithims and other data structures to now infringing and breaking company privacy policy. They can ensure not to cross such boundaries by not using, personal details like health information, work information and where they reside, such sensitive information should never be used or sold without the user's permission. Another ethical issue could be algorithm bias in terms of racial profling, they have to be careful not to prompt or use data that'll cause the algorithm to give answers that may insult a certain group. Example , ask chatGPT to create an image of a single mom and father ran away, then it creates multiple images of black single women, that may be racial bias to the stereotype of black people not knowing their father's.
